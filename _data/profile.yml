    My name is Jeremy. I am a first-year PhD student in <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu">Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan</a>. My advisor at U-M is <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/">Professor Dhruv Jain</a>. Working at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and applied AI, I am interested in creating accessible technologies that enable people of all abilities to connect, create, and engage in meaningful ways.

  <p>
    I am part of the <a href="https://accessibility.eecs.umich.edu">Soundability Lab<a> at University of Michigan CSE. Prior to my PhD career, I pursued a Master's Degree in Information Science / Human-Computer Interaction from UMSI. My undergraduate studies at Ohio State focused on data science and psychology. My undergraduate research, advised by <a href="https://psychology.osu.edu/people/shoots-reinhard.1">Prof. Brittany Shoots-Reinhard<a>, focused on cognitive and affective influences in decision making.
